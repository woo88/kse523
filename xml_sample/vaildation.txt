Using the following online service, we show that the schema correctly validates the sample XML data structure:
W3C XML Schema (XSD) Validation online (http://www.utilities-online.info/xsdvalidation/)
In the above web page, there are two text areas able to check the validity of our XML Schema (XSD) file and check our XML against the Schema.

Please visit the following web pages and then click three buttons separately.
First button is to check whether XML is well formed.
Second button is to check whether XSD is well formed and valid.
Third button is to validate XML against XSD.
For your information, you do not need to copy and paste our files. You have only to visit the following four URLs.
